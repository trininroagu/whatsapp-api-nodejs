# DCS: A-10C Warthog - The Ultimate Close Air Support Simulator
 
DCS: A-10C Warthog is a PC simulation of the U.S. premier Close Air Support attack aircraft. This is the second aircraft in the DCS series, following DCS: Black Shark, and raises the bar even higher in the DCS series. Warthog brings the most realistic PC simulation of a modern fixed wing combat aircraft in regards to flight dynamics, avionics, sensors, and weapon systems[^5^].

The A-10C is an enhanced version of the famous A-10A that served as a major close air support aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, Air National Guard, and Reserves for almost 30 years. A-10C has been upgraded to meet 21 st century standards, using systems such as Multi-Function Color Displays (MFCD), GPS-guided weapons, and data-link support[^5^]. The A-10C can deliver a variety of precision attack weapons (Maverick, JDAM, WCMD, and laser-guided bombs), and an integrated countermeasures system[^5^]. The A-10C also retains its ability to do what it was originally designed to do: kill tanks in a conventional force-on-force battlefield[^5^].
 
The DCS A-10C cockpit is a 100% six-degrees of freedom (6 DOF) cockpit that allows complete freedom of movement around the cockpit. Each panel is reproduced in exacting detail to match operational A-10Cs (Suite 3.1). This includes all panels, switches, dials, buttons being animated, rendered in the 3D, and with high-resolution textures[^5^]. You can also play Warthog in \"Game\" mode for a casual game experience[^5^].
 
You can fly missions in the Caucasus region of the Black Sea against and with a wide array of air, land and sea forces with new and improved intelligence[^5^]. You can also create your own missions and campaigns with the included Mission and Campaign Editors, and fly with and against friends online using the included online game browser[^5^]. In the end of 2019 the aircraft got completely overhauled 3D cockpit model with new acurate hi-poly geometry and detailed 4K textures[^6^].
 
DCS: A-10C Warthog is a simulation that demands dedication to reveal its true worth, and only those prepared to put in the time and effort to mine its treasure trove of avionics challenges will see that beneath the bland exterior lies an experience that'll make you feel like a real combat pilot[^7^]. If you are looking for a realistic and immersive close air support simulator, look no further than DCS: A-10C Warthog.

Some of the features that make DCS: A-10C Warthog stand out from other flight simulators are:
 
- The advanced flight model that accurately simulates the aerodynamics, engine performance, and flight controls of the A-10C. You can feel the effects of wind, turbulence, stalls, spins, and damage on your aircraft. You can also adjust the realism settings to suit your preferences and skill level.
- The detailed damage model that shows the effects of bullets, missiles, rockets, and bombs on your aircraft. You can see holes, dents, cracks, and fire on your fuselage, wings, tail, and engines. You can also lose systems and subsystems due to damage or malfunctions. You can try to manage the damage and continue your mission, or eject if the situation becomes hopeless.
- The interactive training missions that teach you how to operate the A-10C systems and weapons. You can learn how to use the MFCDs, HUD, CDU, TAD, TGP, RWR, CMSP, and UFC. You can also learn how to employ the GAU-8/A Avenger 30mm cannon, AGM-65 Maverick missiles, GBU-12 Paveway II laser-guided bombs, CBU-97 Sensor Fuzed Weapons, and more.

DCS: A-10C Warthog is not only a simulation of the A-10C aircraft, but also a simulation of the modern battlefield. You can fly in dynamic campaigns that change according to your actions and decisions. You can also join multiplayer missions with other players online and cooperate or compete with them. You can communicate with your wingmen, ground forces, AWACS, and JTACs using the radio and voice chat. You can also use the F10 map to plan your route and coordinate with other units.
